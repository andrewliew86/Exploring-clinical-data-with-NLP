9,10,NCT04367662,"May 14, 2020","Coronavirus COVID-19 is an emerging virus also called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Eighty percent of patients are poor or asymptomatic. However, there are major respiratory complications for some patients, requiring intensive care hospitalization and possibly leading to death in 5% of cases. One of the hypotheses put forward is that much of the pathophysiology is due to endothelial dysfunction associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation.||The covid-19 pathology could induce coagulation impairment as observed during sepsis. An increase in D-dimer levels during covid-19 disease is itself associated with excess mortality. While D-dimers are highly sensitive, they are not specific for clotting activity. They may be increased in many other circumstances, particularly in inflammation.||On the other hand, the infection stimulates the release of extracellular vesicles. These vesicles, of multiple cellular origin, are an actor of vascular homeostasis, and participate in the state of hyperactivation of coagulation. They have a major role in the prothrombotic state and the development of coagulopathy associated with sepsis.||The aim of our monocentric prospective study would be to study early and more specific markers of hypercoagulability and markers of routine endothelial dysfunction, as soon as the patient is hospitalized, in order to predict the risk of hospitalization in intensive care.",Study of the Vascular Compartment and Hypercoagulability During Coronavirus Infection COVID-19,,,Biological analysis using initial blood sampling|Biological analysis using initial blood sampling|Biological analysis using initial blood sampling|Biological analysis using initial blood sampling|Biological analysis using initial blood sampling|Biological analysis using initial blood sampling|Biological analysis using initial blood sampling|Biological analysis using initial blood sampling|Biological analysis using initial blood sampling|Biological analysis using initial blood sampling,Not Applicable,COVID-19,COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections|Thrombophilia,France

At the present moment, the effects on the offspring of Covid-19 disease in pregnant women and/or the indirect effect of COVID-19-related prenatal maternal stress are poorly understood. Epigenetic mechanisms - and especially DNA methylation - are involved in the embedding of prenatal exposures to large-scale disasters into the epigenome and phenotypic outcomes of the offspring. Specific target genes include SLC6A4, NR3C1, OXTR, BDNF, and FKBP5. The central hypothesis of this project is that the exposure to the COVID-19-related prenatal maternal stress may affect infants' outcomes from birth to 12 months partially through increased methylation of target genes involved in stress regulation. The main goal is to investigate the association between Covid-19 disease in pregnancy or COVID-19-related PMS in women pregnant during the first 9 months of the year 2020 and the emotional, social, and cognitive developmental outcomes in their infants from birth to 12 months. Additionally, the role of target genes methylation in mediating this association will be investigated.

32,33,NCT04438837,June 2022,"Background: The rapid spread and high infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) makes identifying an effective prophylaxis agent highly important. One of the important target populations for such intervention who are at high risk of exposure are health care workers (HCWs) who may develop disease and/or expose patients and other HCWs. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), currently in usage for treatment of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has in addition to in-vitro activities of inhibition of virus replication and immunomodulation, an important role in the inhibition of pre-entry step of the virus to host cells. Such activity in the early stage of infection may play a role in prevention of disease progression.||Objectives: To evaluate the effect of HCQ in prevention of clinical disease and reduction of viral shedding among HCWs following exposure to confirmed COVID-19 patients.||Study design: Multi-center, randomized controlled, superiority, open label trial Setting: The study will be conducted at Rambam Health Care Campus. Eligibility: Participants eligible for inclusion will include non-pregnant adult (>18 years old) HCWs who were exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19 without full adherence to droplet precautions. Participants will be eligible in a period no longer than 72 hours after exposure.||Intervention: HCQ will be given in the intervention group in a dosage regimen of 400mg BID in the first day followed by 200mg BID for overall 10 days. Participants in the control group will receive no treatment. Treatment will be started no longer than 72 hours following exposure.||Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the number of participants who develop clinical signs compatible with COVID 19 (defined in full protocol) within 14 days of exposure.

36,37,NCT04346589,August 2020,"The 2019 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID 19), which originated in Wuhan, China, has become a major concern all over the world.||Convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins have been used as a last resort to improve the survival rate of patients with SARS whose condition continued to deteriorate despite any attempted treatment.. Moreover, several studies showed a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma than those who were not treated with convalescent plasma. Evidence shows that convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from viral infections can be used effectively as a treatment of patients with active disease.||The use of solutions enriched of antiviral antibodies has several important advantages over the convalescent plasma including the high level of neutralizing antibodies supplied. Plasma-exchange is expensive and requires large volumes of substitution fluid. Albumin is better tolerated and less expensive, but exchanges using albumin solutions increase the risk of bleeding because of progressive coagulation factor depletion. With either albumin or fresh frozen plasma, increasing the risk of cardiovascular instability in the plasma donor and in the recipient, which can be detrimental in a critically ill patient with COVID 19 pneumonia.||The aforementioned limitations of plasma therapy can be overcome by using selective apheresis methods, such as double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP).DFPP is a modality of plasma purification that performs an initial plasma separation from blood, and the subsequent separation of specific molecules, on the basis of their specific molecular weight (cut-off), by using a fractionation filter. The Fractionation Filter 2A20, because of its membrane sieving cut-off, retains larger molecules and returns plasma along with smaller molecules to the circulation, including the major part of the albumin. The selection of the membrane 2A20 is related to the appropriate Sieving Coefficient for IgG that allows to efficiently collect antibodies from patients which are recovered from COVID-19, with negligible fluid losses and limited removal of albumin. The total amount of antibodies obtained during one DFPP session exceeds by three to four times the total amount provided to recipients with one unit of plasma obtained during one plasma-exchange session from one COVID-19 convalescent donor. This should result in more effective viral inhibition and larger benefit for the patient achieved with one unit of enriched immunoglobulin solution obtained with DFPP than with one unit of plasma obtained with plasma exchange.||These observations provide the background for a pilot study aimed to explore whether the infusion of antibodies obtained with one single DFPP procedure from voluntary convalescent donors could offer an effective and safe therapeutic option for critically ill patients with severe coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.",Convalescent Antibodies Infusion in Critically Ill COVID 19 Patients,A.O.

In addition, a large, real-world data registry can provide information about how different concomitant medications may differentially affect symptoms among patient subgroups. Such information can be invaluable for clinicians managing chronic diseases during this pandemic, as well as identify interventions undertaken in a naturalistic setting that have differential effects. Such factors may include patient diet, over the counter or prescription medications, and herbal and alternative treatments, among others. Identifying the natural disease history in patients from different demographic and disease subgroups will be important for identifying at-risk patients and effectiveness of interventions undertaken in the community.||Objectives: The purpose of this study is to understand at the population level the symptomatic course of known or suspected COVID-19 patients while sheltering-in-place or under quarantine. Symptoms will be measured using a daily report derived from the CTCAE-PRO as well as free response.

61,62,NCT04418531,September 2020,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has become a major concern all over the world.||Convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins have been used as a last resort to improve the survival rate of patients with SARS whose condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment with pulsed methylprednisolone. Moreover, several studies showed a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma than those who were not treated with convalescent plasma. Evidence shows that convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from viral infections can be used effectively as a treatment of patients with active disease.||The use of solutions enriched of antiviral antibodies has several important advantages over the convalescent plasma including the high level of neutralizing antibodies supplied. Moreover, plasma-exchange is expensive and requires large volumes of substitution fluid With either albumin or fresh frozen plasma, increasing the risk of cardiovascular instability in the plasma donor and in the recipient, which can be detrimental in a critically ill patient with COVID 19 pneumonia. The use of plasma as a substitution fluid further increases treatment costs and is associated with risk of infections, allergic reactions and citrate-induced hypocalcemia. Albumin is better tolerated and less expensive, but exchanges using albumin solutions increase the risk of bleeding because of progressive coagulation factor depletion.||The aforementioned limitations of plasma therapy can be in part overcome by using selective apheresis methods, such as double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP)3. During DFPP, plasma is separated from cellular components by a plasma filter, and is then allowed to pass through a fractionator filter. Depending on the membrane cut-off, the fractionator filter retains larger molecules and returns fluid along with smaller molecules to the circulation. Thus, the selection of a membrane with an appropriate sieving coefficient for IgG allows to efficiently clear autoantibodies in patients with antibody-mediated diseases (e.g., macroglobulinemia, myasthenia gravis and rheumatoid arthritis) with negligible fluid losses and limited removal of albumin and coagulation factors1.||In patients with severe membranous nephropathy and high titer of autoreactive, nephritogenic antibodies against the podocyte-expressed M type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), DFPP accelerated anti PLA2R depletion4. Measurement of the antibody titer in treated patient and recovered fluid showed that antibody removal was extremely effective and that large part of antibodies was removed during the first DFPP procedure. This therapeutic regimen was safe and well tolerated and easy to apply4. In an ongoing pilot study we found that the same methodological approach can be used to remove circulating antibodies from patients who recovered from COVID 19 and to infuse these antibodies in patients with active viral infection. Treatment was well tolerated and preliminary findings are encouraging. Thus, in this novel pilot study we aim to explore whether the infusion of antibodies obtained with one single DFPP procedure from voluntary convalescent donors could offer an effective and safe therapeutic option for patients with earlier stages of coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring oxygen supply without mechanical ventilation.",Convalescent Antibodies Infusion in COVID 19 Patients,A.O.

However fever reduction in critically ill patients had no effect on survival.||However, these assertions are unclear: upregulation of ACEII would increase the risk of infection, not necessarily its severity, and would only apply to the use of NSAIDs before the infection, i.e. chronic exposure. It would be irrelevant to the infection once the patients are infected, i.e., to symptomatic treatment of COVID-19 infection.||Anti-inflammatory effect masking the early symptoms of bacterial infections resulting in later antibiotic or other treatment is not applicable: there is no treatment of the virus that might be affected by masking symptoms.||Antipyretic effect increasing the risk or the severity of infection would apply equally to all antipyretic agents including paracetamol, which share the same mechanism of action for fever reduction.||EMA remains prudent about this assertion||In addition, excess reliance on paracetamol while discouraging the use of ibuprofen might increase the risk of hepatic injury from paracetamol overdose. Paracetamol is the prime drug associated with liver injury and transplantation, in voluntary and inadvertent overdose or even at normal doses.

185,186,NCT04363593,"November 16, 2020","Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a pandemic-like disease caused by a new coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) isolated in China in 2019. Clinical manifestations vary widely from one individual to another, from asymptomatic carrier to a febrile cough that can rapidly lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, screening by chest X-ray (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 conducted by the Cornwall Hospital Union laboratory has shown that among symptomatic patients and hospital staff suspected of being COVID-19, only 7.8% were attributable to COVID-19. Two nosocomial clusters were also identified, in the emergency department (10 carers) and in the cardiology department (6 carers and one patient). However, direct diagnosis by RT-PCR has sensitivity limits and can lead to false negative results when the subject is indeed suffering from COVID-19. This lack of sensitivity is inherent to the technique on the one hand, but also to the quality of the sample and the kinetics of the infection. Indeed, the virological window during which the virus is present in the respiratory mucous membranes sampled seems relatively narrow, hence a progressive negativation of the respiratory samples as the disease progresses. Moreover, clinical symptoms vary from one individual to another, and it is now recognized that some infected persons are asymptomatic but carry the virus. Thus, the use of a second diagnostic technique is a necessity, and serology could be a relevant diagnostic support.||In the literature, several publications report the performance of COVID-19 serology in clusters of cases or cohorts of subjects. The serological techniques employed are variable (target epitopes in particular) and frequently homemade. Serology is mainly studied in comparison or association with RT-PCR in order to highlight the increased performance of COVID-19 diagnosis when the two techniques are combined. Correlation with chest CT imaging data is also encountered.||Numerous serological tests are therefore being tested to determine retrospectively whether the individual has been exposed to the virus by looking for specific antibodies to the virus. The supreme health authority has drawn up specifications dated 16 April 2020, defining the methods for evaluating the performance of serological tests detecting antibodies directed against SARSCoV-2 in order to provide a framework for these practices. Several clinical studies are also underway, in particular to assess the kinetics of the appearance of the antibodies, whether these specific antibodies would be protective and whether their appearance would coincide with a cessation of contagiousness. Thus, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the COVID-19 immunoglobulin (IgG) Dia-Pro serological test, in view of its deployment at the Cornish Hospital Union Laboratory. Subsequently, given the low prevalence of COVID-19 in Brittany and the risk of a second epidemic wave when the confinement is lifted, the evaluation of the seroprevalence of the staff of the Cornish Hospital Union is necessary in order to assess the attack rate of COVID-19 within the establishment and particularly within departments where nosocomial clusters have been reported; and to prevent the impact of deconfinement. Indeed, knowledge of the proportion of immunized personnel and its distribution according to services will make it possible to establish internal recommendations and to effectively manage personal protective equipment inventories, in conjunction with the deconfinement strategy that will be implemented by the government.

Because SARS-CoV-2 is known to require the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor for uptake into the human body, there have been questions about whether medications that upregulate ACE-2 receptors might increase the risk of infection and subsequent complications. One such group of medications are anti-hypertensives that block the renin-angiotensin system, including both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). Both ACEi and ARB are widely used for the treatment of hypertension. Early reports from China and Italy suggest that many of those who die from COVID-19 have a coexisting history of hypertension. Consequently, there have been questions raised as to whether these 2 types of blood pressure medication might increase the risk of death among patients with COVID-19. However, it is well known that the prevalence of hypertension increases linearly with age. Therefore, it is possible that the high prevalence of hypertension and ACEi/ARB use among persons who die from COVID-19 is simply confounded by age (older people are at risk of both a history of hypertension and dying from COVID-19). Whether these commonly prescribed blood pressure medications increase the risk of COVID-19 or not remains unanswered. Statements from professional cardiology societies on both sides of the Atlantic have called for urgent research into this question. Our study aims to randomize patients with primary (essential) hypertension who are already taking ACEi/ARB to either switch to an alternative BP medication or continue with the ACEi/ARB that they have already been prescribed.

This data has been confirmed by the Italian physicians. The investigators think that the widespread use of inhaled corticosteroids reduces the risk of CoVID-19 pneumonia in patients with chronic lung disease.

Patients with COVID-19 undergo a drastic decrease of T lymphocytes (LT) count, while the remaining ones display an ""exhausted"" phenotype, due to immunosuppressive pathway activation among which the Programed cell Death 1 (PD1) receptor pathways. LT exhaustion is responsible for host anergy towards viral infection and leads to increased risk of severe forms of COVID-19. Moreover, while the number of systemic LT PD1+ correlates with poor prognosis clinical stages of COVID-19 infection, healing from COVID-19 associates with LT PD1 expression normalization. Chinese epidemiologic data identified clinical risk factors of poor clinical evolution (i.e. ARDS or death), among which is found obesity, similarly to observation previously obtained during H1N1 infection (flu virus).||Obese persons display meta-inflammation and immune dysfunction, a condition similar to ageing, thus termed ""Inflamm-aging"", thus also used during obesity. Inflamm-aging, characterized by cytotoxic LT exhaustion and reduced NK cell (Natural Killer cell) cytotoxic function secondary to PD1 pathway activation, could contribute to the poor prognosis observed during cancer and infection in obese individuals. We hypothesize that the immunocompromised profile observed during obesity contribute to their vulnerability towards COVID-19.||In cancer or certain infection diseases, NIVOLUMAB, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, restores exhausted LT immunity. We thus hypothesize that NIVOLUMAB-induced immunity normalization could (i) stimulate anti-viral response also during COVID-19 infection and (ii) prevent ARDS development, which has previously been associated with low LT count concomitant with increased inflammatory cytokine production.||This randomized controlled therapeutic trial, using an add-on strategy to usual standard of care, aims at demonstrating the efficacy and safety of NIVOLUMAB-induced cytotoxic LT normalization, to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19+ adult obese individuals with low LT, since they are at risk of poor prognosis.

The Centre Hospitalier Princesse Grace (CHPG) has decided to only propose randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials to patients at the early and symptomatic stages of the disease. Data from the literature show in vitro results on the potential clinical benefit of some treatments such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HXCQ). Observational data suggest a potential benefit of this treatment alone or in combination with azithromycin (HXCQ + AZ). These data were advertised or led to a request from ambulatory medicine and patients to have access to these treatments despite their poor level of evidence. This leads to a decrease in the number of patients recruitable for clinical trials because they refuse the concept of control arms or they wish active treatment (CQ, HXCQ or HXCQ + AZ) from the start.||In this context, we propose to conduct in parallel with randomized trials, a so-called ""patient preference"" protocol which, after patients information, gives them the choice, either to participate in the trial or to choose between treatment with HXCQ, treatment with HXCQ + AZ or standard of care without medication. The patients follow-up and the main endpoint will be the same under the patient preference protocol as for the randomized trial.||The advantage of this approach is to offer a common follow-up to all patients, to take into account patients who refuse to participate in the clinical trial, to obtain external validity data, to reduce selection bias and to increase the heterogeneity of patients exposed to treatment options.||The expected objective is to see if the patient preference protocol leads to observe the same effects as in the randomized trial.",Patient Preference Trial for COVID-19 (PPT-COVID),,,"Number of death from any cause, or the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation during the 14 days following inclusion and start of treatment.",,Coronavirus,COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections,Monaco

The spectrum of manifestations of COVID19 infection ranges from mild flu-like symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with an associated fatality rate of 1.4%. The suggested mode of entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into the human respiratory epithelium is through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein expressed on alveolar cell surfaces. This entry mechanism has sparked the interest of the scientific community. Preliminary epidemiological reports showed an increased risk of ARDS in hypertensive COVID-19 patients. This leads to the hypothesis that hypertensives treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) are at an increased risk of developing complicated COVID-19 infections . Other studies have refuted these claims as unsupported. Studies revealing the up regulation of ACE2 in cells of patients treated with ACE-I or ARBs were the underlying foundation for these claims.

264,265,NCT04552379,"May 31, 2021","In recent months severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a novel human pathogen and, susceptibility amongst humans is presumed to be universal. Prevention measures of COVID-19 have included distancing, quarantines, use of facemasks in public places, and hand hygiene measures. Mandatory quarantines have also been applied on index cases and their contacts, as well as an active search for asymptomatic patients.||Current strategies to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 do not include measures that could prevent transmission prior to the onset of symptoms. Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been known to shed virus and be contagious for up to 5 days prior to developing symptoms ('pre-symptomatic transmission'). In fact, nearly 60% of all infected subjects can shed virus pre-symptomatically. Pre- or even asymptomatic shedding occurs across all age groups, contributing to the rapidly expanding pandemic.||Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) using type 1 interferon (IFN) can potentially eliminate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. IFN could reduce the period of viral shedding by ~1 week. Since pre-symptomatic shedding of virus can start up to 5 days prior to symptom onset, our approach of a PEP intervention to all contacts recently exposed to a case could possibly entirely interrupt the spread of the virus, and with that, the pandemic. The current study focuses on prevention of the disease in addition to its treatment. Thus, the key distinction between these other trials and this study is that this study focuses on containing coronavirus (i.e. cause) in the community, rather than simply its treatment (i.e. consequence) in the individual.||Viral spread could be eliminated through interventions effective at abolishing viral transmission. However, such post-exposure prophylaxis interventions, that is initiation of antiviral therapy in pre-infectious contacts to reduce or even eliminate such spread, must be safe since they are given to asymptomatic and possibly uninfected subjects. In none of the previous clinical trials of IFN therapy for SARS-CoV-2 have serious adverse events been recorded. Furthermore, the IFN chosen for this study (pegylated IFN 1b) has been extensively studied in clinical trials, and has been in clinical use for years for multiple sclerosis. Pegylated IFN formulations allow for weekly injections while maintaining serum levels and limiting dose-dependent side effects. Together these data support a sound safety profile for the planned intervention.||The aim of this study is to ascertain whether IFN administered to index cases and household contacts of an index case, starting immediately following confirmed exposure (index case confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2), will reduce duration of SARS-CoV-2 detectable by PCR in the index cases, and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detectable by PCR in household contacts.",The Containing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) Trial,,,,Phase 3,SARS-CoV Infection|Interferon|Covid19,COVID-19|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,Chile

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020. To date, tens of millions of cases have been reported and over 3% of these cases have died. COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus from the Betacoronavirus genus, just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets/close contact. Fomite transmission has also been shown as a transmission route. Common respiratory symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough & shortness of breath, may appear 2 - 14 days after exposure. About 20% of infected cases progress to severe disease resulting in an estimated 2 - 5% mortality rate. With the unrelenting increase in cases being reported worldwide, there is thus an urgent need for therapeutics to be developed to treat disease & reduce further transmission in order to disrupt the ongoing pandemic.||To date, there are no specific proven antiviral treatment to prevent disease progression from mild to severe respiratory dysfunction among COVID-19 patients. Supportive care is recommended for symptom relief & for severe cases. Numerous vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are under development. Tychan's TY027, a fully engineered human IgG, is one of the first few biologics in the world, specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2, to enter human clinical trials. Preliminary data from our phase 1 healthy volunteer trial (SCT-001; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04429529) reveals that TY027 is safe & well-tolerated up to 20 mg/kg tested. A total of 10 adverse events (AEs) were observed, all were of mild in intensity with none resulting in subject withdrawal from the study. There were no serious adverse events & no clinically relevant trends in mean clinical laboratory, physical examinations, vital signs or ECG results were observed. Pharmacokinetic profile of subjects across dose cohorts 1 - 4, up to Day 14, were comparable to those typical of human IgG1 antibody with serum concentrations declining in a biphasic manner. Exposure of TY027, based on Cmax, increased in a linear & generally dose proportional manner. It is anticipated that TY027, when administered to acutely infected COVID-19 patients, could reduce disease severity. It may potentially also be used as a prophylaxis against COVID-19 amongst high risk contacts.","Efficacy and Safety of TY027, a Treatment for COVID-19, in Humans",,,"Proportion of COVID-19 patients with disease progression, defined as progression to score 4 and below on the COVID Scale, within the first 14 days after a single dose IV infusion of TY027 as compared to placebo",Phase 3,Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19),COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections,Singapore

Staying home and social isolation are at the top of these precautions. For this purpose, in Turkey on March 21, 2020, '65 and older individuals began to apply the curfew to individuals with chronic illnesses. However, not leaving the house and social isolation brings with it the limitation of physical activity. Physical activity (PA) is defined by WHO as any bodily movement produced by the contraction of skeletal muscles that increases energy consumption. Recommended PA levels for the elderly (≥65 years) are similar to adults (18 to 64 years old). At the global level, approximately 45% of people over the age of 60 do not meet the recommended level of PA. Studies investigating the relationship between social isolation and health behavior report consistent findings. Individuals with smaller social networks report less healthy diets, excessive alcohol consumption, and less physical activity. The effects of social isolation are related to physical inactivity, smoking and the possibility of having both health risk behaviors together. The decrease in physical performance is associated with the risk of falling, sarcopenia, fragility, decreased quality of life, emotionalization, comorbidity, early death, and increased health care costs.

Currently, with nearly 1.3 million confirmed cases, there is still no effective way to contain the disease. The transmission of COVID-19 occurs via direct (prolonged close interaction, within 2 meters for more than 30 minutes) and indirect (fomites) contacts. Locally, the risk of COVID-19 infection in household contacts of confirmed cases is about 4%. These at-risk individuals are identified through contact tracing and infectious may be preventable using post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP). However, there has yet to be a single effective, safe, and affordable pharmacological agent with such capabilities. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a cheap anti-malarial and immunomodulatory agent which may potentially be used as PEP against COVID-19. HCQ is capable of blocking the invasion and intracellular replication of the virus. Existing studies have reported efficacy of HCQ in treating COVID-19, with reduced time to clinical recovery and few reports of patients suffering from significant side effects. However, existing studies are largely limited by their small sample sizes. Furthermore, there has yet to be a published trial on HCQ's role in PEP. This cluster randomized trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral HCQ PEP, taken over for 5 days, in reducing the number of infected household contacts of confirmed COVID-19 patients under home quarantine.

Accurate diagnosis of infection, identification of immunity and monitoring the clinical progression of infection are of paramount importance to our response. Widespread population testing has proven difficult in western countries and has been limited by test availability, human resources and long turnaround times (up to 72 hours). This has limited our ability to control the spread of infection and to develop effective clinical pathways to enable early social isolation of infected patients and early treatment for those most at risk. The life sciences industry has responded to the pandemic by developing multiple new in vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs).

As of January 2021, there are only few authorized vaccines available for the prevention of COVID-19.||""CVnCoV"" is a new SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine which is currently being developed for the prevention of COVID-19. The vaccine contains a molecule called mRNA which serves as an instruction manual for the cells in the body to produce a piece of protein from SARS-CoV-2 which activates the body´s defense system. The ""CVnCoV"" vaccine is injected into the muscle. After the injection, the body recognizes the protein as something that does not belong there. In this way the natural infection with the virus is imitated. The body activates immune cells to produce antibodies against the virus and creates specific immune cells called T cells.||""CVnCoV"" is given in two doses separated by 28 days. In this study, the researchers will look at how well ""CVnCoV"" works when the first of the two doses is given together with a flu vaccine called seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV). They will also look at how well the flu vaccine works under these conditions. The QIV is injected into the muscle and is given as 1 dose. To see how well the participants' immune systems is activated by ""CVnCoV"" and QIV, the researches will measure the levels of specific antibodies against the viruses in the blood. Antibodies are proteins that allow the immune system to find and react to bacteria and viruses in the body. The researches will look into how safe the vaccination is and which type and degree of typical vaccination reactions are seen. To give ""CVnCoV"" and the flu vaccine together in the future when needed, e.g. during the flu season, would reduce the burden on the health system and on the patients.||Participants in this study are adults aged 60 years and older. In this study, participants are assigned to one of the two parallel groups of the same size. The assignment to either group is done by chance via a computer program. Participants in group 1 (Co-ad group) will receive CVnCoV at the same visit as QIV. Participants in group 2 (control group) will receive QIV and CVnCoV at two different visits. The Co-ad group will receive the first dose of CVnCoV and a dose of QIV in opposite arms at Day 1, the second dose of CVnCoV at Day 29, and a placebo injection, i.e. an injection that looks like a vaccination injection but does not contain vaccine, at Day 57.

Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) have been shown to repair damaged liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, skin, cartilage, and cornea in animal models and several human trials.

SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus that display high similarity in both genomic and proteomic profiling with SARS-CoV that first emerged in humans in 2003 in China. Therefore, preventing and controlling the pandemic occurrences are extremely urgent as a global top priority. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, patients may be treated by only addressing their symptoms such as reducing fever. Clinical autopsies from SARS-CoV-infected patients demonstrated that there were major pathological changes in the lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels with vasculitis. However, the detection of SARS-CoV were primarily found in the lung and trachea/bronchus, but was undetectable in spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart and aorta, highlighting the overreaction of immune responses induced by viral infection were really harmful, resulting in the pathogenesis of lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels. To this respect, immune modulation strategy may be potentially beneficial to enhance anti-viral immunity and efficiently reduce the viral load, improve clinical outcomes, expedite the patient recovery, and decline the rate of mortality in patients after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Tianhe Stem Cell Biotechnologies Inc. has developed a novel globally-patented Stem Cell Educator (SCE) technology designed to reverse the autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetes (T1D), Alopecia Areata (AA) and other autoimmune diseases. SCE therapy uses human multipotent cord blood stem cells (CB-SC) from human cord blood. Their properties distinguish CB-SC from other known stem cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Several clinical studies show that SCE therapy functions via CB-SC induction of immune tolerance in autoimmune T cells and restore immune balance and homeostasis in patients with T1D, AA and other inflammation-associated diseases.

The change of laboratory parameters, including elevated serum cytokine, chemokine levels, and increased NLR in infected patients are correlated with the severity of the disease and adverse outcome, suggesting a possible role for hyper-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis.

The mechanisms are unclear.||Colchicine, an old drug used in auto-inflammatory disorders (i.e., Familiar Mediterranean Fever and Bechet disease) and in gout, counteracts the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby reducing the release of IL-1b and an array of other interleukins, including IL-6, that are formed in response to danger signals.

It is estimated that 1 in 5 people diagnosed will require hospital admission and 1 in 20 intensive care treatment. By developing and improving diagnostic testing, we can accurately diagnose infected cases to triage appropriate treatments, identify individuals for quarantine in order to prevent transmission and obtain information regarding patient's immune systems.||At present, the diagnostic test is a highly specific method of genetic amplification called 'Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction' or RT-PCR, which allows detection of very small amounts of genetic mutations caused by the COVID-19 virus. However, this method must be completed in highly specialised facilities, which are few and far between, increasing time to diagnosis (currently 48-72 hours), increasing exposure to non-infected individuals, and overburdening the analysing facilities.

498,499,NCT04851561,"September 2, 2021","Background: COVID-19 is consistently spreading throughout the world, and the number of recovered patients is steadily increasing. Accordingly, a significant number of individuals will develop persisting post-COVID symptoms, while many of them will report on lasting fatigue. The main objective of the current study is to assess risk factors for the development of post-COVID-19 fatigue symptoms. As a secondary aim, the current study is intended to identify pathophysiology and explanatory mechanisms for the post-COVID-19 fatigue.||Study design and population: a nested case-control study will be conducted at Rabin Medical Center (RMC), Beilinson Hospital. RMC runs a post-COVID-19 clinic for adult (age ≥18 years) recovered individuals (diagnosed using a polymerase chain reaction test from a nasopharyngeal sample), who are invited for a comprehensive medical evaluation. During a visit, all individuals undergo pulmonary function testing and an evaluation by an infectious diseases physician, a pulmonologist, and a social worker. The cohort of recovered COVID-19 individuals evaluated at RMC will serve as the population from which the current study participants will be consecutively sampled. The cases would be defined as such if report on lasting fatigue symptoms which appeared following COVID-19, while at least two months have elapsed since COVID-19 diagnosis and the lasting fatigue symptoms are present for at least six weeks. The controls would be defined as those that did not report on fatigue symptoms at any time point since one month following their diagnosis with COVID-19.||Evaluation protocol of cases and controls: All participating individuals (cases and controls) will be assessed following the study protocol. The assessment will be conducted as follows:||First assessment meeting (approximately one hour long) in which the participant will undergo physical examination and blood tests, fill the study questionnaires [demographic, clinical and post-COVID fatigue questionnaire; sleep assessment questionnaires (Epworth sleepiness score [ESS], Pittsburg sleep quality index [PSQI], Insomnia severity index (ISI)]) and depression severity questionnaire (the patient health questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), and conduct cognitive fatigue task.||Second assessment meeting: (approximately one hour long) in which the participants will undergo a cardiopulmonary stress test (CPET).||Data collection: The main dependent variable will be the presence of continuing fatigue symptoms. The independent variables included demographic and clinical characteristics. The demographic variables will include: age at diagnosis, sex, marital status and number of children, occupational status (employed, unemployed, or retired), education (number of years at school and higher education), and occupation. The clinical variables will include: smoking status, alcohol and cannabis consumption, basic physical function (independent, limited in certain activities, dependent in activities of daily living, or bedridden), background illnesses, and pharmacotherapy. The acute COVID-19 history will be also collected: disease severity according to the WHO criteria, symptoms (sore throat, nasal congestion, headache anosmia/disguesia, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and myalgia), need for hospitalization, hospital complications (veno-thromboembolism, super-imposed bacterial infections), for individuals who were not hospitalized - the site of isolation (home, hotel or another isolation facility) will be collected, time from onset to symptoms resolution, pharmacotherapy directed at COVID-19, and information of other household or family members who were also diagnosed.||Statistical methods: Demographic and clinical variables of the patients with fatigue symptoms (cases) and control group (free from fatigue symptoms) will be compared using bivariate and multivariable conditional logistic regression models. Independent variables will be selected to be included in the multivariable model based on the bivariate analysis. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be obtained from the conditional logistic regression models. P<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.||Sample size calculation: Disease severity may serve as a potential risk factor for the development of lasting fatigue symptoms. A preliminary analysis revealed that in our cohort of recovered COVID-19 patients, 20% were hospitalized due to their disease's severity. We will therefore assume that the proportions of individuals required hospitalization during the acute phase were 30% and 10% of the cases and controls, respectively. It is also likely that approximately two thirds of our sample would report on persisting fatigue. Under these assumptions, a sample size of 153 individuals (102 in the cases group and 51 in the control group) will yield a statistical power of 80% at a significance level of 5% for detecting a difference of 0.2 between two proportions.",Post-coronavirus Disease-2019 Fatigue,,,"An abnormal CPET due to either decreased respiratory capacity, muscle weakness or deconditioning",,Covid19|Post-COVID / Long-COVID,COVID-19,Israel

518,519,NCT04470583,November 2021,"Coronavirus infection, also known as COVID-19, has become a global pandemic with over 3 million cases and 250,000 deaths worldwide. Coronaviruses (CoV) belong to a family of viruses that predominately infect mammals and birds, affecting their lungs, intestinal tract, liver and nervous systems. Prior to the discovery of the current novel coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV-2), there were six different strains that are known to infect humans, which includes the virus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2002. In humans, the majority of severe illness from SARs and COVID-19 is due to inflammation of the lungs and pneumonia. Pregnancy poses a significantly increased risk of viral pneumonia and during SARS more pregnant women required intensive care and breathing support, and the proportion of deaths was higher when compared to non-pregnant adults. Furthermore, kidney failure and development of abnormal blood clotting disorders, which occurs during severe infection, is more common in pregnancy and the associated changes in blood vessels extend to the placentas of infected pregnant women, thus potentially affecting the fetus. This makes pregnant women affected by the virus at high risk of developing severe complications. Fortunately, there have been a number of biomarkers identified that are associated with illness severity. These include, specialised white blood cells, blood clotting cells and constituents, as well as other measures of heart and kidney function. We propose that these biomarkers are important correlates of clinical disease severity and prognosis in pregnant and postnatal women. This knowledge has the potential to help clinicians during this pandemic to better manage and care for their patients.",Evaluating Clinical Parameters of COVID-19 in Pregnancy,,,Data collection and analysis on the proportions of leukocyte subsets and thrombocytes in pregnant/postnatal and non-pregnant COVID-19 positive patients during acute infection and recovery.|Data collection and analysis on the concentrations of other biochemical markers of severity in pregnant and non-pregnant COVID-19 positive patients during acute infection and recovery.,,COVID-19|2019 Novel Coronavirus Infection|COVID-19 Infection,Infections|Communicable Diseases|COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections,United Kingdom|United Kingdom

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the 11th March 2020. To date, more than 14,000,000 cases and 600,000 deaths have been reported. COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus from the Betacoronavirus genus, just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets or close contact. Fomite transmission has also been implicated as a transmission route. Common respiratory symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough and shortness of breath, may appear 2 - 14 days after exposure. About 20% of infected cases progress to severe disease resulting in an estimated 2 - 5% mortality reported. With the unrelenting increase in cases being reported worldwide, there is thus an urgent need for therapeutics to be developed and used to disrupt the ongoing pandemic.||To date, there is no specific proven antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Supportive care is recommended for symptom relief and for severe cases, organ support is critical for optimal outcome. Numerous vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are under development and a couple have entered Phase 1 clinical trials. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease is currently being repurposed and undergoing multiple clinical trials to evaluate safety and efficacy in COVID-19 patients. In a preliminary study, convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has also been experimentally administered in critically ill COVID-19 patients with promising results. Donor plasma used was rich in virus specific IgG and IgM antibodies as determined by ELISA. Within days of convalescent plasma treatment, patients showed decrease in viral load (via qRT-PCR), as well as improved clinical status being observed. Tychan's TY027 will be the first biologics in the world, specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2, to enter human clinical trials. It is anticipated that a SARS-COV-2 specific monoclonal antibody therapeutic administered to acutely infected patients could reduce disease severity as well as prevent transmission by reducing viral load and viral shedding.

The biochemical test showed abnormal increase in related indicators such as interleukin-8, and CT images showed a medical ""white"" lung"". According to the experience of SARS treatment in 2003, the use of hormones will indeed help the patients to alleviate their illness, but patients who survived SARS either had too much hormone at that time and took too long. Although the lungs could recover, but the femoral head was necrotic Either the amount of hormones was very conservative at the time, which kept the lungs in the storm of inflammatory factors, leading to the emergence of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. So is there a medicine that can anti-inflammatory, reduce the load of hormone use, and have the effect of treating and preventing pulmonary fibrosis complicated by severe viral lung? At present, pirfenidone has achieved encouraging results in the treatment of idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (CTD-ILD) diseases. It is particularly encouraging that the values announced at the 2019 ATS Annual Conference suggest that pirfenidone has more anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects than its own outstanding anti-fibrotic ability. The data shows early use, Its strong anti-SOD activity can effectively inhibit IL-1beta and IL-4, and can open the prevention mode of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.

However, it is possible that the disease progresses to a severe stage, whith the need for mechanical ventilation support associated with high morbidity and mortality. The progression of the disease is mainly due to the appearance of uncontrolled inflammation that also favors the development of disseminated clots. So far, there is no effective treatment to combat coronavirus; however, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs is potentially effective in preventing complications from the disease. In this regard, low dose colchicine is relatively safe and effective as an anti-inflammatory.

Under normal circumstances, staff may acquire and transmit infections, but the health impact of within hospital infection is greatest in vulnerable patients. For the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, like recent outbreaks such as the SARS and Ebola virus, the risk of within hospital spread of infection presents an additional, significant health risk to healthcare workers.||Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) teams within hospitals engage in practices that minimise the number of infections acquired within hospital. This includes surveillance of infection spread, and proactively leading on training to clinical and other hospital teams.||There is now good evidence that genome sequencing of epidemic viruses such as that which causes COVID-19, together with standard IPC, more effectively reduces within hospital infection rates and may help identify the routes of transmission, than just existing IPC practice. It is proposed to evaluate the benefit of genome sequencing in this context, and whether rapid (24-48h) turnaround on the data to IPC teams has an impact on that level of benefit.||The study team will ask participating NHS hospitals to collect IPC information as per usual practice for a short time to establish data for comparison. Where patients are confirmed to have a COVID-19 infection thought to have been transmitted within hospital, their samples will be sequenced with data fed back to hospital teams during the intervention phase.

COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, has a very polymorphous clinical presentation, which ranges from upper respiratory tract infections to acute respiratory distress syndrome. It may appear serious straightaway or may evolve in two stages, with a worsening 7 to 10 days after the first clinical signs, potentially linked to a cytokine storm and accompanied by a high risk of thrombosis. The global mortality rate of COVID-19 is between 3% and 4%, with severe forms being more frequent among older patients. Management is symptomatic as no antiviral treatment has demonstrated any clinical benefit in this condition. Hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine commonly used in some autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It is active in vitro in cellular models of infection by many viruses such as HIV, hepatitis C or SARS-CoV. However, its interest in viral infections in humans has not been demonstrated.||Very recently, a preliminary uncontrolled study evaluated the effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral shedding in subjects with COVID-19. Among 20 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg per day, the percentage of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharynx decreased from 100% at inclusion (start of treatment) to 43% six days later. In comparison, 15 of 16 untreated patients had a positive RT-PCR six days after inclusion. Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine has immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties, which could theoretically prevent or limit secondary worsening.||The research hypothesis is that treatment with hydroxychloroquine improves prognosis and reduces the risk of death or use for invasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19.",Hydroxychloroquine Versus Placebo in COVID-19 Patients at Risk for Severe Disease,,,,Phase 3,Coronavirus,COVID-19|Coronavirus Infections,France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|Monaco

The grounds for the proposal are rooted in existing knowledge on the components and pharmacological features of this formulation and their relevance to the current understanding of the disease process being addressed.||The severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness results from the immediate response to the viral infection as well as from a subsequent host inflammatory response. Systemic proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers are elevated as the disease progresses towards its advanced stages, and correlate with worse chances of survival.||Serum cytokine levels that are elevated in patients with Covid-19-associated cytokine storm include interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, IP-10, TNF, interferon-γ, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1α and 1β, and VEGF. Higher interleukin-6 levels are strongly associated with shorter survival. The relative frequencies of circulating activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and plasmablasts are increased in Covid-19. In addition to the elevated systemic cytokine levels and activated immune cells, several clinical and laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated CRP and d-dimer levels, hypoalbuminemia, renal dysfunction, and effusions, are also observed in Covid-19.

Forms of varying severity of COVID-19, a disease induced by this emerging virus, have been described in pregnant women. In addition to the direct effects of the virus on the pregnant woman and the fetus, the pandemic context itself is likely to act as a psychological risk factor and to alter the protective factors for mental disorders. This pandemic context is in itself anxiety-provoking, even traumatogenic, particularly because of the potentially lethal infectious risk that it conveys, all the more so in psychologically vulnerable populations. In addition to the fear of viral contamination, the fear of childbirth and the postpartum period, which includes a more or less important part of anxiety-provoking uncertainty, is added to the fear of viral contamination in the perinatal period. This addition of stress factors is likely to increase the prevalence of perinatal depressive disorders and anxiety disorders, particularly the psychotraumatic experience of childbirth. Sanitary and social measures, such as quarantine, restriction of access of accompanying persons to maternity unit, or contagious isolation of mothers suspected of being infected or infected, which may furthermore impose a separation of mother and child, are also likely to have psychopathological consequences.||In this context, three maternity wards of the PREMA University Hospital Federation (UHF PREMA) : Groupe hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph (GHPSJ), Louis Mourier Hospital (APHP) and Port-Royal Hospital (APHP), in partnership with the ""Centre de Psychopathologie du Boulevard Brune (CPBB)"" and the psychiatry department of the Louis Mourier Hospital have set up a care protocol consisting of a systematic screening offered to women following childbirth on the first day of their pregnancy, aimed at identifying those with perinatal anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Hypertension and cardiovascular disease are risk factors for death in COVID-19. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important component of the renin-angiotensin system, serves as the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates host cell entry in the lungs. In experimental models, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to increase ACE2 expression in several organs, potentially promoting viral cell invasion, although these findings are not consistent across studies. Alternatively, ACEIs and ARBs may actually improve mechanisms of host defense or hyperinflammation, ultimately reducing organ injury. Finally, ACEIs and ARBs may have direct renal, pulmonary and cardiac protective benefits in the setting of COVID-19. Therefore, it is unclear if ACEIs and ARBs may be beneficial or harmful in patients with COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disease in the world, the high prevalence of ACEIs or ARBs in these conditions, and the clinical equipoise regarding the continuation vs. discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs in the setting of COVID, a randomized trial is urgently needed.

For this, a needle is used to collect blood from an arm vein. For participants who have a central line, blood will be collected through that instead.||Participants medical records related to COVID-19 will be reviewed.||Participants who have recovered from COVID-19 will be asked to undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood cells. For this, blood is taken from a needle placed in one arm. A machine separates out the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the participant through a needle placed in the other arm.

643,644,NCT04389580,October 2021,"Combination Therapy with Isotretinoin and Tamoxifen expected to provide Complete Protection against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus||Abstract:||The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over 150,000 deaths.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 and for which there are currently no approved treatments.The principal investigator reported according to previous research data that combination therapy with Isotretinoin and tamoxifen expected to provide Complete Protection against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. A study demonestrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to increase ACE2 expression, In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P>0.1) Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening. As Investigators discussed before in their previous clinical trial (NCT04353180) that Isotretinoin is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2. and the principal investigator expects that Isotretinoin can inhibit or downrgulat ACE2 by direct interaction and binding with the transmembrane ACE2, Suggesting its therapeutic potential in preventing the entry of COVID 2019 to the host cell. The second combined drug is tamoxifen, A study demonstrated that tamoxifen causes redistribution of weak base chemotherapeutics from acidic organelles to the nucleus in drug-resistant cells. Agents that disrupt organelle acidification (e.g., monensin, bafilomycin A1) cause a similar redistribution. Measurement of cellular pH in several cell lines reveals that tamoxifen inhibits acidification of endosomes and lysosomes without affecting cytoplasmic pH, Tamoxifen decreased the rate of vesicular transport though the recycling and secretory pathways. Organellar acidification is required for many cellular functions, and its disruption could account for many of the side effects of tamoxifen. A sudy demonstrated that the phagocytosis is inhabited by tamoxifen and chloroquine in retinal epithelial cells and Also, a study demonstrated that Tamoxifen have weak base property and increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal dynamics. Importantly, TAM treatment enhanced survival of mice injected with a lethal dose of STx1 or STx2, TAM allowed TAM to increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal dynamics. A study demonstrated that Tamoxifen have antimalarial effect via treating mice infected with P. berghei, which show lower levels of parasitaemia and do not develop signs of cerebral malaria, Tamoxifen is found to prevent lung fibrosis and reduce serum TGFβ-1 levels. A study Reported that Tamoxifen have endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases inhibitory effect better than chloroquine , Cathepsins are endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases that play important roles in protein degradation in various cellular processes including both the endocytic pathway and autophagy. The role of cathepsins in viral infection was first identified by Huang et al and they found that one cysteine proteases inhibitor E64d and a specific cathepsin L inhibitor Z-FY(t-Bu)-DMK are able to block the SARS-CoV infection. A study demonestrated that Cathepsin D was more sensitive to tamoxifen than to chloroquine. Tamoxifen exposures decreased the cathepsin D activity at less than 10 pM concentrations. The effect of chloroquine started at concentration of 15 pM, Finally, the principal investigator expects strong inhibition of COVID-19 by this combination therapy.||In addition, Tamoxifen has anti estrogenic effect Therefore the principal investigator expects that Tamoxifen will protect patients with cancer against COVID-19 infection.||Keywords: COVID 2019 , Isotretinoin , Tamoxofin, ACE2,.Endosomal and Lysosomal pH.",Combination Therapy With Isotretinoin and Tamoxifen Expected to Provide Complete Protection Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,Kafrelsheikh University,Mahmoud Ramadan mohamed Elkazzaz,Proportion of lung injury score decreased or increased after treatment,Phase 2,COVID-19,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,

Hypovitaminosis D is common in Winter (October to March) at Northern latitudes above 20 degrees North, and from April to September at Southern latitudes beyond 20 degrees below the equator.||In the past, coronaviruses and influenza viruses have exhibited very high seasonality, with outbreaks occurring preferentially during the Winter. The Covid-19 pandemic is indeed more severe above Winter latitudes of 20 degrees, while it remains until now less severe in the Southern hemisphere, with a much lower number of deaths.||Preclinical research suggests that the SARS-Cov-2 virus enters cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Coronavirus viral replication downregulates ACE2, thereby dysregulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and leading to a cytokine storm in the host, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).||Research also shows that vitamin D plays a role in balancing RAS and in reducing lung damage. On the contrary, chronic hypovitaminosis D induces pulmonary fibrosis through activation of RAS. Similarly, hypovitaminosis D has been strongly associated in the literature with ARDS, as well as with a pejorative vital prognosis in resuscitation but also in geriatric units, and with various comorbidities associated to deaths during SARS-Cov-2 infections. Conversely, vitamin D supplementation has been reported to increase immunity and to reduce inflammatory responses and the risk of acute respiratory tract infections.||High-dose oral vitamin D3 supplementation has been shown to decrease short-term mortality in resuscitation patients with severe hypovitaminosis D (17% absolute risk reduction). It is considered safe to take oral vitamin D supplementation at doses up to 10,000 IU/day for short periods, particularly in older adults, i.e. a population that is mostly affected by hypovitaminosis D and who should receive at least 1,500 IU of vitamin D daily to ensure satisfactory vitamin D status.||Vitamin D supplementation is mentioned as a potentially interesting treatment for SARS-Cov-2 infection but on a scientific basis with a low level of evidence until now.||We hypothesize that high-dose vitamin D supplementation improves the prognosis of older patients diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to a standard dose of vitamin D.",COvid-19 and Vitamin D Supplementation: a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial of High Dose Versus Standard Dose Vitamin D3 in High-risk COVID-19 Patients (CoVitTrial),,,,Phase 3,Coronavirus,COVID-19,France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France

Strategies to reduce the need for all of the above are immediately needed. Further, few interventions are targeted in COVID infected patients early in the course of their disease and especially in the community/home settings. Respiratory decompensation appears to occur later in the disease process (i.e. 7-10 days after becoming symptomatic) therefore many patients are sent home from the Emergency Room and they subsequently decompensate later at home.

One possible explanation is that the immune system of elderly people, might be exhausted by chronic stimulation associated with comorbidities and more susceptible to this Sars-CoV-2 effect. As a result, in these patients, the activation of the innate immune system might fail to produce an adequate adaptive response (i.e., virus-specific CD8+ T-cells).

The occurrence of progressive inflammatory factor storm and coagulation dysfunction in severe and fatal cases of NCP points out a new direction for reducing the incidence of severe and critically ill patients, shortening the length of duration in severe and critically ill patients and reducing the incidence of complications of cardiovascular diseases. Aspirin has the triple effects of inhibiting virus replication, anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory, but it has not received attention in the treatment and prevention of NCP. Although Aspirin is not commonly used in the guidelines for the treatment of NCP, it was widely used in the treatment and prevention of a variety of human diseases after its first synthesis in 1898. Subsequently, aspirin has been confirmed to have antiviral effect on multiple levels. Moreover, one study has confirmed that aspirin can inhibit virus replication by inhibiting prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in macrophages and upregulation of type I interferon production. Subsequently, pharmacological studies have found that aspirin as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug by inhibiting cox-oxidase (COX). Under certain conditions, the platelet is the main contributor of innate immune response, studies have found that in the lung injury model in dynamic neutrophil and platelet aggregation.||In summary, the early use of aspirin in covid-19 patients, which has the effects of inhibiting virus replication, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory and anti-lung injury, is expected to reduce the incidence of severe and critical patients, shorten the length of hospital duration and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular complications.",Protective Effect of Aspirin on COVID-19 Patients,,,"TTCR is defined as the study treatment (oral aspirin enteric-coated tablet) began to fever, breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation recovery, and cough relieving for at least 72 hours.|Time of SARS-CoV2 in upper respiratory tract specimens overcasting detected by RT-PCR.",Phase 2|Phase 3,Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia|Aspirin|Treatment,COVID-19|Pneumonia|Coronavirus Infections,China

ARDS is usually associated with a mortality of around 40%, but this rate reaches 61% in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Two endotypes have been described in patients with ARDS: one, hyper-inflammatory, associated with very high mortality (51%); the second, slightly inflammatory (immunoparalysis), associated with much lower mortality (19%). In COVID-19 patients, distinct immune response profiles have also been observed. Some patients present deep lymphopenia and/or prolonged viral excretions associated with more frequent occurrence of co-infections (+ 29% of virus, + 23% of bacteria, + 10% of fungi). The latter group may be at higher risk in terms of mortality. The intensity of the inflammatory response and/or microbial coinfections therefore appear as risk factors for severity and mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 which determine the course of the disease. To adapt early optimal therapeutic management to each forms of the disease, it is essential to be able to characterize these profiles on the microbiological and inflammatory level.||With a committed network of 6 intensive-care units across eastern and northern Ile-de-France, 180 patients with ARDS and infected with SARS-CoV-2 are being enrolled.

The main difference of the novel Coronavirus is the higher mortality rate, that is around 3%.||Death rate is over 1% only for patients over 50 years old, whereas until 40 years old is under 0,4%. No fatalities are declared among children under 10 years old to date. Death rate is almost double for male rather than female. This distribution of mortality rate according to age of infected patients could be only partially ascribed to other comorbidities in addition to great age. In fact, patients with no pre-existing conditions have however a case fatality rate of 0,9%.||The almost null rate of severe illness in children and generally in patients younger than 40 years old is quite un-explicable. Infant, children and young people could be infected but infection is rapidly self-limited or without symptoms. Older patients undergo severe lung injury as consequence of an immune response that is late in coming.||Possible explanation of these phenomena could be something, which assure ability to prompt response to SARS-CoV-2 in younger people independently from the novelty of the virus itself.||It would seem to be that younger people are already sensitized to the antigens of the virus without a previous contact.||This immunity is not really specific, but ""partially specific"" for many antigens of the virus, however able to limit the infection in the organism. Something stimulated the immune system and it scattered immunity against more and more antigens present. Children are the age group mostly exposed to all community-circulating viruses.||This immunity is not persistent but progressively fade out. It protects from the age of two, when the hypothetical stimulation occurs, to the fifth decade because of its slow decrease.||The only external stimulation, which healthy people receive are vaccines. All vaccinations and especially tetanic, diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis could stimulate immune system. They develop the specific immunity but generate also a sprouting immunity against antigens in transit, as coronaviruses and other community-circulating viruses.||The developed immunity gives some protection against multiple viral infection for years until the natural fade out.||After the fifth decade, that immunity is slower to be recall and reactivated. Additionally, transplant recipients and HIV infected patients, which have an immune system inhibited, unexpectedly, do not seem to suffer the worst complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. An immune system imbalance could be play a pivotal role during the reaction to the virus, limiting destructive consequences of excessive inflammation.||According to the medical hypothesis on which the protocol is based on, young people could benefit from a functional adaptation of innate immune cells induced through epigenetic reprogramming and, especially, a pre-existing ""partially specific"" immunity to the community viruses caused by ""bystander effect"" of preceding vaccinations. In this study, we will explore the main differences existing among patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 who experience the illness at different degree of severity. We suppose to recognize different populations of patients, each one with a specific immunological pattern. It could differ in terms of cytokines, soluble factors serum level and immune cells activity both of the innate compartment and of the acquired one.

Epidemiological evidence points to the existence of intrinsic protection factors which make young persons and women more resistant to the infection, whereas older patients with multiple illnesses, above all with heart disease, are at greatest risk. This trial proposes treatment initiated in the early stages of the disease, when clinical worsening is most likely, with intravenous Oxytocin (OT), an endogenous hormone currently safely used in clinical practice. The selection of this molecule is based on numerous experimental and clinical observations, which show its activity in modulating resistance to pathogens, in mitigating overall cardiovascular risk, and in acting on the production of Nitric Oxide (ON) in the lungs, which is emerging as a key therapeutic factor for the improvement of respiratory function in patients with SARS-COVID 19. Finally, OT is physiologically produced by the human body, especially in the female sex and in the age ranges that coincide with most resistant patients. In routine clinical practice, OT exhibits an excellent therapeutic index, in absence of significant adverse effects.||Primary aim To assess the effects of Oxytocin in addition to standard therapy, with respect to Standard of Care (SoC), in reducing the number of patients who enter a critical stage Secondary aim||To describe:||Mortality 28 days after randomization|Time to mechanical ventilation during the study|Duration of dependency on oxygen supply|Length of stay|Temporal trend of clinical improvement (7-category ordinal scale)|Safety analysis",Phase II RCT to Assess Efficacy of Intravenous Administration of Oxytocin in Patients Affected by COVID-19,Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma,Tiziana Meschi,Proportion of cases who during 14 days exhibit one of the following conditions (the most severe):||respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation|organ failure that requires intensive care monitoring and treatment|death,Phase 2,Covid-19|Corona Virus Infection|SARS-CoV 2,COVID-19|Virus Diseases|Coronavirus Infections,France|Italy|Italy

Paradoxically, others suggest that a reactive immune response might be the cause for severe tissue damage, and that immunosuppression might be protective from the postulated cytokine storm.||Some studies stated that the LT patients who are permanently on immunosuppressants could be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and their prognosis could be worse in comparison to the normal population. They recommended that LT recipients should be closely monitored for SARS-CoV-2.||The LT society of India (LTSI) highlighted the potential of LT recipients as asymptomatic carriers and source of viral spread, and that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to LT recipients. There are insufficient data on the relationship between immunosuppressive therapy and COVID-19 in LT recipients during this pandemic. However, the Beijing working party for liver transplantation suggested that LT recipients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be treated with steroids for a short period to reduce the severity of pneumonia.||They also suggested that immunosuppressive therapies should be continued for both patients with mild COVID-19 and those who were not infected by the virus, and calcineurin inhibitor treatment dosage should be reduced in moderate to severe cases.||Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) play an important role in virus clearance and have been considered as a key immune product for protection or treatment against viral diseases. Virus-specific NAbs, induced through either infection or vaccination, have the ability to block viral infection. SARS-CoV -2 specific NAbs reached their peak in patients from day 10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained stable thereafter in the patients. Antibodies targeting on different domains of S protein, including S1, RBD, and S2, may all contribute to the neutralization.||Al-Rajhi Liver Center is the only liver transplantation center in Upper Egypt that performed only 51 living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) cases since 2014, but it was used as isolation Hospital for COVID-19 cases from March to July, 2020.

This evidence-based hypothesis is related to several observations. Macrophages, activated T and B lymphocytes have a vitamin D receptor and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 induces defensin protein synthesis, influences immunoglobulin production and modulates T-cell cytokine production and functions. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 also reduces the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that is believed to serve as the binding site and gateway for COVID-19 to become infectious. This is a multicenter randomized3 doubleblinded placebo-controlled study aimed at determining the benefits of 25(OH)D3 treatment for the prevention of COVID-19 infection and improving clinical outcomes in infected patients.

Up to date, many subjects affected by the virus report important sequelae on different organs increasing morbidity and exacerbating previous pathological conditions. Mortality is also increased in cases of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes. COVID-19 infection is caused by Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Concerning the specific interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the cardiovascular system, we know that this virus enters the body through the receptors for the conversion of angiotensin II (ACE2r) that are present in the lungs, heart, intestinal epithelium and vascular endothelium. This receptor's availability suggests a multi-organ involvement with a consequent multi-organ dysfunction, as found in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection.||Furthermore, poor vascular peripheral function -usually correlated with old age and long periods of bed rest or hypomobility- is a distinguishing characteristic of the population affected by COVID-19, as well. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that peripheral vascular function, already deteriorated by aging and common age-related diseases, can be further compromised by COVID-19 and by the forced hypomobility, typically experienced during the acute phase of the disease.||The main aim of this project will be to investigate the peripheral NO-mediated vascular function in the leg of patients recovering from Covid-19 pneumonia.||A significant vascular dysfunction is expected to be found in post COVID individuals and to be correlated to the relevant clinical variables.",NO-mediated Vascular Function in Covid-19 Patient,Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri SpA,Paola Baiardi,"Leg Blood Flow will be analyzed with an ultrasound examination using the Single Passive Leg Movement technique.||In particular, the investigation consists of an ultrasound performed on the common femoral artery using Doppler method with a linear probe with a frequency of 5 MHz.||The subject will be placed in a sitting position at rest for 20 minutes before the test is performed.

About 5% of patients infected with SARS CoV-2 have a critical form with organ failure. Among critical patients admitted to intensive care, about 70% of them will require ventilatory assistance by invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) with a mortality rate of 35% and a median MV duration of 12 days. The most severe lung damage resulting from SARS CoV-2 infection is the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The virus infects alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells leading to an activation of endothelium, hypercoagulability and thrombosis of pulmonary capillaries. This results in abnormal ventilation / perfusion ratios and profound hypoxemia. To date, the therapeutic management of severe SARS CoV-2 pneumonia lay on the early use of corticosteroids and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist, which both reduce the need of MV and mortality. The risk factors of death in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are: advanced age, severe obesity, coronary heart disease, active cancer, severe hypoxemia, and hepatic and renal failure on admission. Among MV patients, the death rate is doubled in those with both reduced thoracopulmonary compliance and elevated D-dimer levels. Patients with severe alveolar damage are at risk of progressing towards irreversible pulmonary fibrosis, the incidence of which still remain unknown. The diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis is based on histology but there are some non-invasive alternative methods (serum or bronchoalveolar biomarkers, chest CT scan).

While most patients have a mild or uncomplicated disease (80%), approximately 15% need hospital care and 5% intensive care. Severe cases are characterized by pulmonary involvement which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Early identification of patients who are likely to get worse is therefore a major issue.||While, chest X-ray has poor diagnostic performances, pulmonary computed tomography (CT scan) seems very sensitive (97%) and quite specific of COVID-19.

However, performing CT scan in all or many patients with suspected COVID-19 may result in radiology department overload, especially, taking into account bio-cleaning between patients. Moreover, CT scan may lead to adverse effects including induced cancer due to the cumulative diagnostic irradiation.||Chest ultrasonography may be an alternative to CT scan. It is a simple, non-invasive, non-irradiating, inexpensive and available at the point of care (POCUS).

The disease caused by this coronavirus was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Since March 11, 2020, the WHO has described the global situation of COVID-19 as a pandemic. In Côte d'Ivoire, as in other African countries, the number of cases is increasing exponentially.||Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe pathologies. COVID-19 can result in fever or a feeling of fever (chills, hot-cold), cough, headache, aches and pains, unusual tiredness, sudden loss of smell, total disappearance of taste, or diarrhea. In severe forms, respiratory difficulties can lead to hospitalization in intensive care or even death.||Numerous studies are currently being conducted around the world to seek effective treatment, but few of them have started specifically in Africa. Moreover, most of these studies are using a single drug to control the infection, whether these are repositioned drugs, i.e. already being used for other diseases, or other newer drugs.||Currently in Côte d'Ivoire, the preferred treatment for COVID-19 is an antiviral: lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), usually directed against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).||Since the number of viruses (viral load) is high in the respiratory tract during COVID-19 infection, we propose in INTENSE-COV (ICOV) clinical trial to study whether the combination of two drugs is more effective than taking a single drug on reducing the viral load in the respiratory tract but also on reducing inflammation.||These drugs include the LPV/r already in use in Côte d'Ivoire as well as an antihypertensive drug - telmisartan, and a drug that lowers blood cholesterol - atorvastatin. All three have been known for a long time and have been shown to be effective against other viruses. In addition, they are generic, inexpensive and readily available in all countries.||The objectives of the ICOV study are therefore to improve viral eradication from the patient's body and respiratory tract, to reduce inflammation, to improve more rapidly the patient's state of health and to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to others.||To participate in ICOV, patients must be over 18 years of age, have a COVID-19 infection confirmed by a specific test, have clinical manifestations of the infection, and have signed an informed consent. They will then be randomized into 3 treatment groups to ensure the robustness of the study results. The reference group will be treated with LPV/r, according to current recommendations in Côte d'Ivoire. The other 2 groups will be treated with LPV/r + telmisartan and LPV/r + atorvastatin respectively.

869,870,NCT04511429,October 2020,"Viral respiratory infections are common infectious complications after kidney transplantation, especially in the pediatric age group, and immunosuppressed patients may develop more severe disease. Immunosuppressive medications alter the patient's immune response by acting on humoral, cellular immunity and neutrophil function, increasing the risk of serious viral infections. Little is known about how these patients respond to infection by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).||Experience with SARS caused by the Influenza H1N1 virus suggests that the severity of the disease depends on pre-existing comorbidities and the individual immune response. In more severe cases, an imbalance between the inflammatory system and the immune system is observed, determining direct consequences when pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines reach the systemic circulation in an exacerbated and unbalanced manner. Such fact can generate ""cytokine storm syndrome"", resulting in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.||March 2020 reports from Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy - one of the largest pediatric liver transplant centers - showed that the number of transplant patients infected with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) increased progressively. However, they did not see greater severity and complications in this population. Immunosuppression could act as a protective factor.||The present study aims to describe the prevalence of viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 in a sample of immunosuppressed children, from three groups: kidney transplants, liver transplants and oncohematological. The investigators will also look for the epidemiological profile and clinical evolution of these patients, enabling a better understanding of the COVID-19 in this special population. The investigators' hypothesis is that infection with the new coronavirus may be asymptomatic in a large number of children and that immunosuppression, observed in liver and kidney transplant patients and also seen in cancer patients, may act as protection for severe forms of COVID-19.||After obtaining written informed consent from the family, the investigators will include patients from 0-18 years of age, on regular outpatient follow-up, symptomatic or not, and will check for the presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2.

877,878,NCT04505761,"February 1, 2021","Patients who receive intensive care are known to be at high risk for physical, psychological, and cognitive impairments, a constellation known as PICS. COVID-19 patients are expected to have high chances of suffering from PICS (PICS-COV) as they frequently require several weeks of intensive care and traditional PICS preventive measures are virtually impossible due to infection control precautions, prone positioning, and deprivation of social contact. To prevent PICS after ICU discharge in COVID-19 patients, physical therapy is recommended. From recent but limited experience it appears that even patients with COVID-19 who have not been admitted to the ICU can suffer from impairments in the same domains and sometimes to a similar degree of severity. Also for these patient group rehabilitation seems warranted.||Yet, the resources needed to provide rehabilitation treatment to COVID-19 patients are inadequate because healthcare systems faced a shortage of high-quality treatment for these impairments already before the COVID-19 crisis emerged. Virtual Reality (VR) provides potential to healthcare practitioners to administer fast, temporary, and tailor-made rehabilitation services at a distance, and offers a solution to address the impending surge of demand for rehabilitation after COVID-19 infection. VR consists of a head mounted display (HMD) that can bring the user by computer-generated visuals into an immersive, realistic multi-sensory environment. Current VR technology is accessible, easy in use for a large audience, and safe in use. There already exist multiple VR applications for providing physical, psychological, and cognitive rehabilitation. These applications have been brought together in a VR suite for rehabilitation after COVID-19. Patients visiting a physiotherapist for rehabilitation from COVID-19 will be asked to participate in this study. They receive a VR HMD for training purposes.

Since then, it has spread to almost 200 countries and infection rates are rapidly accelerating.||Overactivation of T cells resulting in immune dysfunction, dysfunction of the renin angiotensin system, and antibody-dependent enhancement are thought to contribute to the cytokine storm that results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), culminating in death. In addition to causing respiratory symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 can cause diarrhea and has been isolated from the stool. SARS-CoV-2 binds to Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on lung alveolar type 2 cells, but ACE2 is also expressed in the absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon. The diarrhea may be caused by increased intestinal permeability due to binding of these receptors by the SARS-CoV-2.||Thus, an intervention to attenuate this cytokine storm may improve clinical outcomes in people with COVID-19. One such intervention is oral administration of serum bovine immunoglobulins, which decreases interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels safely with minimal side effects. Animal and human clinical studies have shown dietary supplementation with oral immunoglobulins improves mucosal immunity, specifically respiratory/pulmonary and GI mucosa, and decreases systemic inflammation, reducing the symptoms and severity of pulmonary inflammation and viral infections.||Hypothesis:||Dietary supplementation with EnteraGam® will decrease IL-6 levels and prevent disease progression in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.||Objectives:||To evaluate the effectiveness of the oral nutritional therapy EnteraGam® (serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate) to prevent disease progression of COVID-19 and to decrease IL-6 levels as compared to standard of care in subjects with COVID-19.||Methods:||Randomized open-label clinical study evaluating the effectiveness of EnteraGam® 10.0 g BID (every 12 hours) added to standard of care, as compared to standard of care alone, in subjects with COVID-19.",Evaluating the Impact of EnteraGam In People With COVID-19,,,"Variation of IL-6 levels measured in plasma|Percentage of patients with COVID-19 who have disease progression by Week 2, defined as:||For outpatients, return to emergency department for COVID-19 related manifestations or worsening of ≥1 level on the World Health Organization (WHO) 9-point ordinal scale.|For inpatients, worsening of ≥1 level on the WHO 9-point ordinal scale.",Not Applicable,Covid19,COVID-19,Spain

A new (SARS)-CoV infection epidemic began in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in late 2019; originally called 2019- nCoV the virus is now known as SARSCoV- 2 and the disease it causes COVID-19. Previous CoV epidemics included severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, which started in China in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in the Middle East, which started in 2012. The mortality rates were >10% for SARS and >35% for MERS. The direct cause of death is generally due to ensuing severe atypical pneumonia and ensuing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pneumonia also is generally the cause of death for people who develop influenza, although the mortality rate is lower (1%-3% for the influenza A H5N1 pandemic of 1918-1919 in the United States). Risk factors for a poor outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection have so far been found to include older age and co-morbidities including chronic cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and current smoking status.

Prohibitions on visits to Nursing Homes and care services, although essential to control the epidemic, are also becoming a major source of social isolation and loneliness for these fragile populations. The only source of residual social ties during a period of confinement remains dematerialised communication via the various existing communication channels (in particular telephone calls or video telephony).||As soon as the COVID-19 crisis began and the first visiting restrictions were imposed on patients in the geriatric department of the Angers Univesity Hospital and the Retirement Home / long-term care unit, acute care geriatric unit of Angers offered patients and residents the opportunity to organize communication with their relatives via videophone calls. Initial feedback from the field shows us that, contrary to our intuition, patients and residents are not necessarily asking for communication to the outside world and, when they are, the preferred channel is not necessarily video telephony but often a simple phone call with relatives. Even though the vast majority of projects aimed at setting up communication aids for the elderly now rely on videophonic support, these initial observations in everyday care situations raise questions about the directions taken in this area. Also, the investigators ask themselves the following question: in the absence of a physical meeting, what is the preferred means of communication for elderly people in isolation in hospital or in Retirement Home?

A customized disease specific understanding will be important to understand subsequent disease waves, vaccine development and therapeutics. For this reason, ISARIC (the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) was set up in advance. This focuses on hospitalised and convalescent serum samples to understand severe illness and associated immune response. However, many subjects are seroconverting with mild or even subclinical disease. Information is needed about subclinical infection, the significance of baseline immune status and the earliest immune changes that may occur in mild disease to compare with those of SARS-CoV-2. There is also a need to understand the vulnerability and response to COVID-19 of the NHS workforce of healthcare workers (HCWs). HCW present a cohort with likely higher exposure and seroconversion rates than the general population, but who can be followed up with potential for serial testing enabling an insight into early disease and markers of risk for disease severity.

In the epithelial cells, the enzyme superoxide dismutase catalyzes a reaction leading from hydrogen peroxide to the ion superoxide. The induced oxidative stress stimulates a local innate response via activation of the toll-like receptors and the NF-κB. Those kinds of reactions are also activated by viral infections. Virus-induced oxidative stress plays an important role in the regulation of the host immune system and the specific oxidant-sensitive pathway is one of the effective strategies against viral infections. Therefore, nose/mouth/throat washing with hydrogen peroxide may enhance those local innate responses to viral infections.
